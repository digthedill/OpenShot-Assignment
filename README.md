### Simple Video Editor Attempt

So I enjoyed trying this assessment. I had trouble in the beginning uploading to the demo api and understanding the necessary request data. I chewed up most of my time trying to get my app to interact with the demo api.

The design is extremely simple, but responsive. I don't think I knew what I was working on until 3 quarters of the way done, so I'm sorry the design isn't more interesting.

I called it quits when I could not get past the final 400 error to export the video. I had a plan to present everything in the end, but I decided I'd already gone over 8 hours and figured it'd be better to stick closer to the alloted time.

Thanks for the opportunity. I look forward to hear your notes!
